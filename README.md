# Central-Limit-theorem
Central limit theorem(CLT) is one of the most widely used theorems in statistics. It is the core of hypothesis testing. It lets us use data to evaluate our ideas better. If we have a population and we take sufficently large random samples from it, then the sample means will be approximately normally distributed. Take any distribution(need not be guassian). Every distribution will have a mean and variance. Take N samples(preferrably N>30) and compute its mean. If we plot the distribution, we get a guassian distribution, which has a mean roughly equal to population mean. So, to understand population mean and population variance, of any distribution, We just need to know that they are finite and well-defined. CLT says that the sampling distribution of sample means for any popluation with a finite variance and finite mean is a guassian distribution, with a mean tending towards population mean.
